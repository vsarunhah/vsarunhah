## Hi there! I'm Varun Shah 👋

🚀 **Software Developer | Cloud Enthusiast | Problem Solver**  

I love building innovative applications, solving complex problems, and constantly learning new technologies. Currently, I'm working on **[Bondly](https://bondly-fe.vercel.app)**, a website that allows you to stay connected with friends, without needing to schedule meetings around everyone.  

### 🌱 What I'm Learning
Currently deep-diving into AWS OpenSearch Service and optimizing search capabilities. Also prepping for upcoming **Python interviews**! 🐍💡

⚡ **Fun Fact:** I enjoy working on side projects and exploring cutting-edge tech in my free time! If you love Python, Go, Java, or cloud computing, let's connect! 🚀

#### Here's a quick summary of my Github Profile:

However, I don't think that numbers do justice to a programmer. So, if you're looking at this you should look my pins.
