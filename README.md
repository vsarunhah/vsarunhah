I **love** learning about a lot of things and I want to be conversationally fluent in everything I hear about, whether it's politics, psychology or art. It seems to give me a unique way of looking at the world and who _doesn't_ want that?

However, I don't think that numbers do justice to a programmer. So, if you're looking at this you should look my pins.
